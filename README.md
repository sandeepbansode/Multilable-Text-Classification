# Multilable-Text-Classification
Multi-Label Text Classification means a classification task with more than two classes; each label is mutually exclusive. The classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label. On the opposite hand, Multi-label classification assigns to every sample a group of target labels.
